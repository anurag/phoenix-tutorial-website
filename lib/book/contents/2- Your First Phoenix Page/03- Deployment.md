"Deployment" is the process of getting code from your computer to the wider world.  In this case, it's getting it to a web server where people can view your website (currently a barely-customized default app) by putting a URL in their browser.

For the purposes of this tutorial we recommend using Heroku.

The official Phoenix documentation for deploying to Heroku is quite good: http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku

Go there and follow the instruction, because I have nothing useful to add to them.  Just make sure to replace all instances of hello_phoenix and HelloPhoenix with the name of your app.

If this book ever makes it to a paper edition then I'll write something up at that time.  Until then, use the official docs: http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku

See you in the next chapter, where we start customizing our app.
