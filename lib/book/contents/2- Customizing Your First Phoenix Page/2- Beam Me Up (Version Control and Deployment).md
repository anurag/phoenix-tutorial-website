## Deployment

"Deployment" is the process of getting code from your computer to the wider world.  In this case, it's getting it to a web server where people can view your website (currently a barely-customized default app) by putting a URL in their browser.

For the purposes of this tutorial we recommend using Heroku.

[The official Phoenix documentation for deploying to Heroku](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku) is quite good.

Go there ([http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku)) and follow the instruction, because I have nothing useful to add to them.  You'll need to be connected to the internet to deploy your app anyways.  Just make sure to replace all instances of hello_phoenix and HelloPhoenix with the name of your app.

If this book ever makes it to a paper edition then I'll write something up at that time.  Until then, use [the official docs](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku).

See you in the next chapter, where we start customizing our app.
