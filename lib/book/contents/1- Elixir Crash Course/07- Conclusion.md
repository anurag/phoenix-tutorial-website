# End of Part 1

That's most of the Elixir you need to know in order to understand a basic Phoenix app.

There's plenty of Elixir that I've left out, including some stuff that's used within Phoenix. I've left out several commonly-used things like `Enum.map` and anonymous functions because we're going to get pretty far into our app before we start needing them.  And of course there's all the advanced topics- Channels, Metaprogramming, OTP, etc.- because while they're really cool, they have no place at the start of a beginner's guide.  Finally, I've left out some of the more project-focused stuff- Import, Use, configuration files, various mix commands- because those are better understood while in the context of a full Phoenix app.

What that means is that our crash course in Elixir is finished- it's time to get started building a Phoenix app!
